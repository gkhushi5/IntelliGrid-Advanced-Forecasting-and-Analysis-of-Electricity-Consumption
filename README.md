# IntelliGrid-Advanced-Forecasting-and-Analysis-of-Electricity-Consumption
Project Overview
IntelliGrid is a comprehensive project aimed at analyzing and forecasting electricity consumption using advanced data processing and machine learning techniques. The project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model implementation, evaluation, and future consumption prediction.

Objectives
1. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the dataset: Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Datetime Formatting: Combine date and time columns into a single datetime format for effective time series analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Uncover Patterns and Trends: Conduct EDA to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in electricity consumption.
Visualize Feature Relationships: Visualize relationships between different features to gain insights into the data.
3. Time Series Forecasting Models
Model Implementation: Implement forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM to predict future electricity consumption.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics to determine their accuracy and reliability.
4. Feature Engineering
Investigate Feature Impact: Examine how various features influence electricity consumption.
Create New Features: Develop new features to potentially enhance prediction accuracy.
5. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust model hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
Model Validation: Validate and optimize the models using a separate test dataset to ensure robustness.
6. Future Consumption Prediction
Generate Forecasts: Produce forecasts for future electricity consumption based on trained models.
Interpret Predictions: Visualize and interpret the predictions to identify potential consumption patterns.
